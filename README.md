**Given-Taken is my favorite song in this album aside from let me in. This theme was about a vampire with applicable references being made in the lyrics. But beyond that, the lyrics are meant to express ENHYPEN's (Jay, Ni-Ki, Jake, Heeseung, Park Sung-hoon, Jungwon and Sunoo) feelings in relation to their newfound stardom.**
