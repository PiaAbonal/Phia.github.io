"One, Two, Connect! Annyeonghaseyo enhaipen-ibnida!" Enhypen, commonly stylized as ENHYPEN, is a South Korean boy 
band formed by Belift Lab, a joint venture between CJ ENM and Hybe Corporation. Formed through the 2020 survival competition show I-Land, the group is composed of seven members: Jungwon, Heeseung, Jay, Jake, Sunghoon, Sunoo, and Ni-ki. Here are some of my favorite songs in their albums :)

# BORDER: DAY ONE 

###### **Given-Taken** 

One of my favorite song in BORDER: DAY ONE is Given-Taken. Given-Taken is a song partially based on a vampiric theme, with applicable references being made in the lyrics. But beyond that, the lyrics are meant to express ENHYPEN's (Jay, Ni-Ki, Jake, Heeseung, Park Sung-hoon, Jungwon and Sunoo) feelings in relation to their newfound stardom.

# BORDER: CARNIVAL 

###### **Fever**

Not only it recieve recognition internationally but it also gain more fame in the group because of this masterpiece. 
Fever is about wanting someone to acknowledge their presence, compares their body temperature to vampire (an ongoing supernatural theme in ENHYPEN universe), and hoping to get healed after much suffering.

# DIMENSION: DELIMMA 

###### **Upper Side Dreamin'** 

This song is one of the best b-sides aside from fever. It helps me feel relaxed and calm while doing my modulebut sometimes it can distract you because of it's catchy tone.
